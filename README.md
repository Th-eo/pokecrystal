This is an unnamed hack based on Pok√©mon Crystal.
TODO before next commit:
* Finish setting up deep snow and deep sand as encounter-able DONE
* Correct and last touches to new tilesets NOT DONE: Need to fix snow/sand
* Generic is currently blank and featureless, should be the tileset used in most of the game save particular overworld environments/requiring of specific buildings etc. Maybe high-tech for towns.
* Rename tilesets to Haunt/Frost/Dune DONE
