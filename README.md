This is an unnamed hack based on Pokémon Crystal.
Current TODOs
* Correct and last touches to new tilesets NOT DONE: Need to fix snow/sand
* Generic is currently blank and featureless, should be the tileset used in most of the game save particular overworld environments/requiring of specific buildings etc. Maybe high-tech for towns. (On-going process)

Next goals:
* Intro sequence (Prof. Vitalba)
* Mapping and scripting early game

Pokédex goals:
* Healthy mix of Gen 1-8 Pokémon (simplified movesets and evolution methods)
