This is an unnamed hack based on Pok√©mon Crystal.
TODO before next commit:
* Finish setting up deep snow and deep sand as encounter-able
* Correct and last touches to new tilesets
  *** Generic is currently blank and featureless, should be the tileset used in most of the game save particular overworld environments/requiring of specific buildings etc.
* Rename tilesets to Swamp/Frost/Dune
